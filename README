This Chrome Extension makes it easier to share file links for SD2 by replacing another person's username with your own.
When I send you a link [https://jupyter.sd2e.org/user/jeg/tree/sd2e-community], it will replace `jeg` with the username
you set in the script.



How to install:
    1) Replace my username, `"jeg"`, with yours on line 10 `background.js`
    2) Open Chrome Settings -> More Tools -> Extensions
    3) Enable _Developer Mode_
    4) Click _Load unpacked extension_
    5) Select this _sd2ify_ folder.

Test it out.
    Once loaded, try opening [https://jupyter.sd2e.org/user/jeg/tree/sd2e-community]
    You'll notice that in the url, my username is automatically replaced with yours.
